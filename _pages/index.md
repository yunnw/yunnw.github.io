I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ninghao Liu](https://ninghaohello.github.io/). Prior to joining UGA, I obtained my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Analytics from the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/), where I was advised by [Prof. Dugald Macpherson](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4056/professor-dugald-macpherson), and my dissertation was supervised by [Prof. Douglas Parker](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/9226/douglas-parker).

## Research Interests

My long-term goal is to build **reliable**, **data-efficient LLM systems** and **agentic workflows** for **real-world use**. I pursue this through three connected layers:

- **Data-Centric Efficiency (Foundation)**: Generate and curate synthetic data, perform data selection and curriculum design, and turn scarce or noisy supervision into strong performance at controlled cost.
- **Reliable Reasoning & Self-Refinement (Core)**: Improve step-level correctness by verifying intermediate steps, detecting errors, and enabling autonomous correction with consistency-based training signals.
- **Auditable Agentic Workflows (System)**: Design planning and tool-use workflows with robust evaluation harnesses and traceable execution, integrating the above capabilities into practical, controllable automation.

Currently, I also work under the guidance of [Prof. Xiaoming Zhai](https://people.coe.uga.edu/xiaoming-zhai/), in collaboration with [ETS](https://www.ets.org/), to study and operationalize the methods outlined above in real-world contexts, including educational settings such as LLM-based agents and assessment technologies (automated scoring, feedback generation, learning analytics).
